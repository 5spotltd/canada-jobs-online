All too often we are reminded that we live in very competitive economic times. Just think about all the hundreds of thousands of educated, talented, skillful people in Canada (not to mention the world) who cannot find employment. We know the stories all too well. Whether youâ€™re a struggling student looking for a decent paying job or a seasoned professional who has had your position eliminated due to job cuts. It is upsetting but unfortunately a reality throughout Canada. 
This is why our micro job website was created. To help you!
